            <h1>Shivaji College is a premier institution in West Delhi, accredited with grade 'A' by NAAC. </h1>
            <p><hr>Shivaji College functions under the trusteeship of the Government of Delhi. It was established in 1961 by Hon'ble 
                Dr Panjabrao Deshmukh, Union Minister for Agriculture and a renowned social activist and farmer-leader. His vision 
                was to provide higher education for boys and girls in the predominantly rural area of Matiala. The Government of Delhi took the 
                trusteeship of Shivaji College into its possession and relocated it to Karampura in 1967. Shivaji College was further shifted to the present campus in Raja Garden in 1976.<br><hr>
                The location of Shivaji College is quite enviable with two metro stations in close vicinity of the college and an 
                extensive bus service that enables students to commute from different parts of the national capital region. There 
                are other amenities like general hospital, bazars, banks, post-office, etc. nearby the college. The college campus
                 has photocopy facility, banking and health-care services, and a cafeteria and kiosks for beverages and snacks.<br><hr>
                In spite of being located in the thriving part of the city, Shivaji College campus is extremely verdurous. 
                It has a maze of tall trees, lush green lawns and pruned hedges. Apart from the academic and administrative sections of the college, the campus located 
                in ten acres of land includes a sports ground and a residential complex for the staff.<br>
                The college offers twenty undergraduate courses in Science, Commerce and Humanities, a self-financing course
                 in Bachelors in Business Economics, three post-graduate courses, and an add-on course in German. Several senior 
                 faculty members supervise Ph.D. scholars registered with University of Delhi, while some engage in UGC-sponsored major 
                 and minor research projects.<br><hr>
                Shivaji College believes in and promotes the ideals of gender equality and community service. To this 
                effect the college offers some relaxation in cut-offs to female students during the time of admissions. 
                The college also honours and celebrates men and women working towards women's empowerment and confers on 
                them the Jijabai Achievers Award. <br><hr>
